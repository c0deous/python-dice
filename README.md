<b>Python Dice</b>

Python Dice is a simple program that rolls an ASCII Art 6 sided die within the command line.  I wrote this for fun in about an hour.
Note: This requires the termcolors python package.
<b>Usage</b>
 - `-2` or `--two-dice` rolls two dice instead of one and totals them.
 - `-v` or `--verbose` displays more output and fancyness.
 - `-h` or `--help` displays this help message.
