<h1>Python Dice</h1>

Python Dice is a simple program that rolls an ASCII Art 6 sided die within the command line.  I wrote this for fun in about an hour.<br>
<b>The only dependency is ANSI support for colors (dropped support for the termcolors package)</a>.</b>
<h2>Usage</h2>
 - `-2` or `--two-dice` rolls two dice instead of one and totals them.
 - `-v` or `--verbose` displays more output and fancyness.
 - `-h` or `--help` displays this help message.
